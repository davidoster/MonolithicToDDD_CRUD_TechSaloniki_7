# A demo as a showcase monolithic app transformed via clean architecture design to DDD

This was created by the following PeopleCert Education Coding Bootcamp ex Students on a 3-months intensive Bootcamp
After been hired as Technology Interns, we follow an intensive induction course.
We developed after 2-months along with training by using advanced software technologies; a new project based on the Monolithic Application having Clean Architecture Design.
This was a major challenge for us, since we had no experience on building such complicated projects.
